# Minesweeper

I used Python 3.9 and Numpy 1.19.3

This is a simple minesweeper game that I made for fun.
I finished this game in a week. I worked on it 2 to 3 hours every day.
I tried to use OOP, but I couldn't manage to use it effectively.
I tried to finish the game quickly, but I ended up spending more time.
Because, code is not well organized, comments are poorly written and 
there is not enough comments. 
Lastly, there are some minor bugs, and I am too tired to debug them.
